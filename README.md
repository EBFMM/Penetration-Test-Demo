# Penetration Test Demo

## Objective

The objective of this penetration test demo is to demonstrate the exploitation of a SMB (Server Message Block) vulnerability on the target system. The focus is to identify and exploit a weaknesses in this service, gaining unauthorized access, and successfully exfiltrating sensitive data. This demo highlights the critical risks associated with improperly secured network services and underscores the importance of robust security measures in protecting sensitive information from potential threats.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced skills in assessing network services and identifying critical security vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
