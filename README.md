# Penetration Test Demo

## Objective

The objective of this penetration test demo is to demonstrate the exploitation of a SMB (Server Message Block) vulnerability on the target system. The focus is to identify and exploit a weaknesses in this service, gaining unauthorized access, and successfully exfiltrating sensitive data. This demo highlights the critical risks associated with improperly secured network services and underscores the importance of robust security measures in protecting sensitive information from potential threats.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of network service vulnerabilities and their impact on system security.
- Proficiency in utilizing Metasploit for exploiting SMB vulnerabilities and gaining system access.
- Ability to execute comprehensive penetration tests and simulate real-world attacks on network services.
- Enhanced skills in assessing network services and identifying critical security vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- OpenVAS to provide a detailed report on potential threats and known vulnerabilities within the network.
- Metasploit framework, utilized for conducting penetration testing, by running an exploit module against the target machine to simulate a real-world attack.
- John the Ripper tool for password cracking.
